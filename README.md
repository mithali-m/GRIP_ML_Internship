# GRIP_ML_Internship

Four tasks based on- Linear regression, K-means clustering, Decision trees and EDA on Business Analytics.

My 1st Task by The Sparks Foundation internship is a regression task which will predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the number of hours they studied. This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just two variables.

My 2nd Task is to explore Unsupervised Machine Learning. From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, I have predicted the optimum number of clusters using K-Means Clustering and represented it visually.

My 3rd Task is to explore Decision Tree Algorithm. For the given ‘Iris’ dataset, I have created the Decision Tree classifier and visualized it graphically. The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.

My 4th Task is to explore Business Analytics, to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the provided dataset 'SampleSuperstore' in order to find out the business problems and increase the profit for the business owner.
